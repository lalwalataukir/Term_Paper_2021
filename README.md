## Prediction of Concavity Mean of Breast Cancer Cell using Multiple Linear Regression
Concavity of breast cancer cell is predicted by various models developed in this
term paper. Majorly two models are developed, Multiple Linear Regression and
Multiple Polynomial Regression. Multiple Linear Regression is modified and
Errors are reduced. Multiple Linear Regression performs better when
modifications are done and manually some features are squared by observing
how the data is scattered.

Concavity can be predicted with acceptable accuracy and error. Multiple Linear
Regression can predict concavity with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
0.03034 and Coefficient of Determination (R-squared) 88.68 %. Multiple Linear
regression model can be modified and model with RMSE 0.02388 and R-squared 92.79
% can be obtained.

* Multiple Linear Regression : Hypothesis have all the features with power 1.
* Polynomial Linear Regression : Hypothesis have all the features with power 2.
* Improved Models : Selectively some features are sqaured and it results in lesser error and better Coefficient of Determination
