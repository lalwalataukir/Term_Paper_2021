## Prediction of Concavity Mean of Breast Cancer Cell using Multiple Linear Regression
### Concavity of breast cancer cell is predicted by various models developed in this
term paper. Majorly two models are developed, Multiple Linear Regression and
Multiple Polynomial Regression. Multiple Linear Regression is modified and
Errors are reduced. Multiple Linear Regression performs better when
modifications are done and manually some features are squared by observing
how the data is scattered.
